# IZ*ONE Bias List Generator

The IZ*ONE Bias List Generator is a responsive list generator based on user input. Each member of IZ*ONE, a popular South Korean-Japanese girl group, will be placed head-to-head for the user to select one option of the two, the results being placed in a list which is displayed upon completion.

This project was inspired by existing K-Pop bias sorters on tumblr.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GIT, Bash.

## Personal Learnings

This was my first experience with a binary insertion sorter and using a switch case statement in JavaScript. I made this project in order to develop my JavaScript skills and become more comfortable with manipulating what displays on a web page.

## Installation Instructions

To run the IZ*ONE Bias List Generator, download this project and then run on a local server of your choice.
